This is a very old project I worked on during break the freshman year of my undergrad but I'm adding a README for anyone that crosses it! :) 

These are some helper astrodynamics/orbital mechanics scripts in Matlab based off the book "Fundamentals for Astrodynamics"

I wrote these for study and for solving the problems in the book, for example, computing the trajectory of the Molniya satellite and designing spy satellite orbits


These scripts feature different methods of orbit propagation/determination, hohmann transfers, 3-vector determination, etc

As a bonus I wrote a script that numerically computes the ground track of space vehicles over the Earth, it doesn't consider the rotation of the Earth (an oversight at the time, but easy to implement now)

Maybe I'll implement trajectory optimization for rendezvous using co-planar hohmann transfers next? Fun project idea for kOS & Kerbal Space Program
